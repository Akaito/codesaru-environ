# codesaru-environ
Go-esque environment for C++ and whatever other projects.

Easy-to-use consistent structure for working on projects.  Templates and some scripts make it easy to create new projects (libs, console projects, etc.).  Making new templates is also easy.

Super-minimal/-simple "module" downloaders inspired by Go's easy module import/download.  These list available codesaru-environ-compatible modules and allow the user to git-clone them right from the script and quickly fill out a new environ sandbox.

Still have work to do on dependency management between projects...
