# codesaru-environ
Go-esque environment for C++ and whatever other projects.

Easy-to-use consistent structure for working on projects.  Templates and some scripts make it easy to add new projects, and to add new templates.

See src/get-src.py and project/get-project.py for simple resource downloaders.  Super-minimal/-simple downloaders inspired by Go's easy module import/download.  These list available codesaru-environ-compatible modules and allow the user to git-clone them right from the script.
